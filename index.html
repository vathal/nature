        <img src="images/img.1.jpg" height="400px" width="300px">
        <p>Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, 
           photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty.
           Reasons why this association exists,and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics</p>

        <p>If nature has the ability to protect us, it is also powerful enough to destroy the entire mankind. 
            Every form of nature, for instance, the plants, animals, rivers, mountains, moon, and more holds equal significance for us.
            Absence of one element is enough to cause a catastrophe in the functioning of human life.
             We fulfill our healthy lifestyle by eating and drinking healthy, which nature gives us. 
             Similarly, it provides us with water and food that enables us to do so. Rainfall and sunshine,
              the two most important elements to survive are derived from nature itself.</p>
